# Drive Blog

A super simple, Google Drive based blog.

## Install

First get the files locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makers-upv/web.git
cd ./blog
```

Then you will need to install them. For this you need Node.js:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the file `.env_demo` as `.env` and fill in the private variables. Then run it:

```bash
node app.js
```

Open `localhost:3000` and you should see your blog.
